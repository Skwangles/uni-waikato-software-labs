## Your Task: Finding the value of PI

Your task for this assignment is to write an OpenCL program that calculates the value of PI (3.1415...) by a simulation of throwing thousands of darts randomly into a 1x1 square that contain a circular dart board (as shown in the red area of the graph underneath). 
 
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Pi_30K.gif"  width="240" height="240">

The area of the square is 1, while the area of the circle is pi/4. So multiplying the proportion of darts that fall inside the circle by 4 will give us an approximation of PI. This approximation will get better as the number of darts grows larger but is a very computational intensive task. (note that Yee and kondo attempted [12.1 trillion digits](http://www.numberworld.org/misc_runs/pi-12t/) to get the most accuracy of Pi value, and it take 94 days and 70 TB of disk space to complete!!!) 

This assignment is described as follows. 

 We will use thousands of OpenCL work-items (threads), with each one performing several hundred or thousand random throws. To do this, each work-item must generate random numbers between 0.0 ... 1.0 for the X and Y position of each dart. We will use a linear congruential pseudo-random generation method, as follows:

```
  randomSeed = (a * randomSeed + c) mod 2^32
```

where the mod 2^32 is done in hardware via integer overflow (we just ignore the overflow bits), and a=1103515245 and c=12345 (these are the values used by glibc/GCC). So to generate each random number, we can simply execute the following assignment (where 'rand' is an int):

```
  rand = 1103515245 * rand + 12345;
```

HINT: We should generate one random number for X and then another one for Y. And we can convert the resulting random integer into a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0 by using the below equation to lower 24 bits:

```java

            /* extract 24 bits for x */
            float x = ((float) (rand & 0xFFFFFF)) / 0x1000000;
            ...
            if (x*x + y*y < 1.0 ){
                // Dart (x, y) is inside the circle
            }
```        

Or we can simply generate a random integer without lowering its bits:

```java
            /* x ranges from 0 upto 2^24 -1 */
            long x = rand & 0xFFFFFF; // 0<=x<=2^24 -1 (16777215)
```        

And then we use the below formula to check if X and Y are within the circle.

```java
            x * x + y * y <= 0xFFFFFE000001;
        
```

Note the kernel with integer or long type has potential integer overflow issues. So when calculating the squares of X and Y values and the sum of both values, we must be very careful about the range values of X and Y and the maximal values that an integer and long type can hold. Otherwise, the kernel will run into errors and output a very strange pi value.

It is usually wise to start by implementing our kernel code in C-like Java code first, so that you can debug and test it. That is, implement your 'kernel' method with Java code that only uses ints, floats and doubles (no objects), and maybe some one-dimensional arrays of those types (not necessary for this lab exercise). For this dart-throwing program, we would start by implementing a method like: 

```java
          /**
           * A dummy Java-version of our kernel.
           * This is useful so that we can test and debug it in Java first.
           *
           * @param seeds one integer seed for each thread (work item).
           * @param repeats the number of darts each thread must throw.
           * @param output one integer output cell for each thread
           * @param gid dummy global id, only needed in the Java API, not the OpenCL version.
           *            (delete this parameter when you translate this to an OpenCL kernel).
           */
          public static void dummyThrowDarts(int[] seeds, int repeats, int[] output, int gid) {
              // int gid = get_global_id(0);  // this is how we get the gid in OpenCL.
              int rand = seeds[gid];
              for (int iter = 0; iter < repeats; iter++) {
                  // TODO: write this code
              }
          }
        
```
Once we have Java version of dart-throwing function, we can rewrite this function to an OpenCL kernel, and execute the kernel using JOCL library. 
```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		if (args.length != 3) {
			System.err.println("Usage: pi threads workgroupsize repeats kernel");
			System.err.println("      (threads must be a multiple of workgroupsize)");
			System.exit(1);
		}

		final int wgSize = Integer.decode(args[1]);
		final int repeats = Integer.decode(args[2]);

		System.out.println("Selected CLDevice: " + JOCLUtil.getDeviceInfoString(device, CL_DEVICE_NAME) + "\nDevice Version:"
				+ JOCLUtil.getDeviceInfoString(device, CL.CL_DEVICE_VERSION));// Show device

## Tasks

The project repository contains a copy of the above code, plus a Results.xlsx spreadsheet to record your results and answers. It also includes the JOCL.jar file. You can access the JOCL API docs at http://www.jocl.org/doc/index.html. Note that our lab machine is installed with OpenCL 1.2, so we cannot use OpenCL 2.0 APIs , such as clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties.

Implement the dummyThrowDarts method. Use floats since speed is more important than accuracy. Insert comments to explain what your code does.

Run JOCLPiTest class to test dummyThrowDarts function with two following test cases:

```
  1.  int[] results = new int[6];
      JOCLPi.dummyThrowDarts(new int[] { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }, 1000, results, 0);
      // check that results[0] is around 750 and results[1..5] are 0.

  2.  int[] results = new int[6];
      JOCLPi.dummyThrowDarts(new int[] { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }, 1000, results, 5);
      // check that results[5] is around 750 and results[0..4] are 0.
```

After your tests pass, rewrite your Java dummyThrowDarts code to kernel.cl file.

```C++

            // OpenCL kernel 'throwDarts' using float type
            __kernel void throwDarts(__global int *seeds,
                                       const int repeats,
                                     __global int *output){
	            // Your code goes here

            }
```            

So that our program can read it to srcCode string using the below code:

```java

            String srcCode = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("kernel.cl")));
```        

Then, we can convert the syntax into OpenCL (also, remove the* gid* parameter, since this will be obtained via calling *get_global_id(0)*), and run your OpenCL program in Lab machines! Experiment with different numbers of threads and different repeat values, and notice how the value of PI gets more accurate as you throw more darts. Keep a spreadsheet of your experiments (see Results.xls in the given project), to record the number of work items, the number of repeats (dart throws) that each work item does, the total number of dart throws, the resulting value of PI, and the time taken for that run. (Ideally, perform several runs with a given parameter value, and record the minimum or median time, to get more reliable results). Keep on increasing the total number of darts until you reach some time limit (like the 5 second timeout on Windows from the maximal kernel execution time on CUDA ).

For your submission, perform the following three experiments, and show the results of each experiment on a separate graph. (Hint: Before you start these experiments, optimize your kernel code to remove any square root calls, by comparing the squared numbers rather than taking the square roots and comparing the results.)

**Ex1.** Using at least 10,000 threads and a large enough repeat number to make your whole program take several seconds to execute, experiment with different workgroup sizes. That is, hold the number of threads and repeats constant, and vary the workgroup size to find the most efficient workgroup size on the Lab One graphics cards.
Q1: What is the optimal workgroup size?
    
**Ex2.** Using the optimal workgroup size that you found in the previous experiment, vary the number of threads up and down so it covers at least two orders of decimal magnitude (eg. from 256 to 32768 in powers of two). Plot the average execution time per dart (in nanoseconds) on your graph.
Q2: Over what range of threads is the execution time proportional to the number of darts? That is, how many threads do you need to make the time per dart roughly constant?
    
**Ex3.** Create a third version of your kernel procedure called throwDartsInt that uses the 'int' type for all calculations. Then repeat the previous experiment and plot the additional curve.
Q3: Are ints faster than floats? What speedup do they give? (e.g 2.0X means twice as fast, 0.5X means twice as slow)
    
Your final spreadsheet should have three graphs, one for each of the above experiments, plus the answers to the above questions.


## Submission checklists
* Make sure that your pi darts program compiles and runs correctly (i.e. no run-time exceptions). 
* Make sure that your program prints out the following messages in the same format as the original program. For example:
```                    
                    ...
                    Starting with 12800 threads, each doing 100000 repeats
                    Done in 207919 microseconds
                    Estimate PI = 1005332658/1280000000 = 3.14166455625
```                    
           
* Make sure you have filled in the pi_darts/Results.xlsx in the project directory and committed and pushed all the changes to the file.  
* Make sure you have pushed all changes to the repository. Ensure that you can see your changes on GitLab before submission.
