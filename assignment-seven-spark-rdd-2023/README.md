# Assignment Seven Apache Spark RDD (10%)

**Due date Friday 19 June at 11:30 pm**

## Instructions and important things to note

* Fork the project by clicking the "Fork" button on the top-right corner.
* **Make sure that the visibility of your new repository (the one you just forked) is set to private.**
* You can obtain the URL of your forked project by clicking the "Clone" button (beside "Fork") and then the “copy to clipboard icon" at the right of the dropdown.
* Clone the new repository to your computer and open the project with IntelliJ, by using command line or IntelliJ interface.
    * Using the Git command line: You will need to install a Git client yourself if you are not using the lab machines. In a termial on your computer, clone the assignment one repository to your computer using the command “git clone `<url you copied>`”. Open the project into your IntelliJ workspace. (*File* / *Open* the project directory).
    * IntelliJ: Alternatively, you could get the project from GitLab repository via IntelliJ interface. From the menu bar, *Git* > *Clone* > *Copy* the url to Repository URL > *Clone* (Reference: Get a project from version control: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/import-project-or-module-wizard.html)
* Commit your changes regularly, providing an informative commit message and using Git inside IntelliJ (Commit and Changes Tutorial: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/commit-and-push-changes.html)

You are expected to make at least 10 commits with messages to explain what have changed. 5 out of 50 marks are allocated for this.


## Installing Scala Plugin within IntelliJ

The tutorial of how to install Scala Plugin with IntelliJ see here (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/discover-intellij-idea-for-scala.html)

Alternatively, click on WikipediaStats.scala file in IntelliJ. IntelliJ displays the below suggestion message 
> <pre>"Plugins supporting *.scala found."                                      Install Plugins</pre>

Select `Install Plugins` to install Scala Plugin in IntelliJ. Restart IntelliJ to start the plugin.


## Install Apache Spark on your computer

Download Apache Spark from http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html. Unpack it somewhere on your computer. You should use version Spark 2.0.x up that supports new DataFrame and Dataset API. We will call the install directory your `SPARK_HOME` directory.

Note: A copy of Spark distribution is also available in /home/compx553/spark-2.3.1-bin-hadoop2.7

You can use it by mounting the drive using a simple command on the terminal on lab machines:

```
$ ls /home/compx553/spark-2.3.1-bin-hadoop2.7 
```


## Set up a Scala project in IntelliJ

Before compiling and running `WikipediaStats.scala`, you need to include **SPARK** libraries in `SPARK_HOME/jars` to IntelliJ.

From the menu bar, select *File* > *Project Structure* > *Project Setting* > *Modules* > *Dependencies* Tab

*+* Button > *Library* > *Java* > Select `SPARK_HOME/jars` folder to include all jar files to the project > OK

```diff
- !Important! Apache Spark needs to use the fixed version (2.11.11) of Scala compiler. The latest Scala compiler (>= 2.12.0) may cause errors.
```

Note: The datasets used in this assignment are available on lab machines at

```
     /home/compx553/spark/wikipedia_stats.wikipedia_meta_history1 

     /home/compx553/spark/wikipedia_stats.wikipedia_meta_history2 
```

copy them in the top level of your Eclipse workspace. If you are using lab machines, you can specify the paths in the code.


Right click on `WikipediaStats.scala` > Modify Run configuration > Add the below program arguments 

> **wikipedia_stats.wikipedia_meta_history1 wikipedia_stats.wikipedia_meta_history2**

See if you can run the program within IntelliJ and get the output message like the below:
